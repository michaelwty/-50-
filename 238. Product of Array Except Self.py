# Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, Â return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# Example:

# Input:  [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

# Follow up:
# Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res, l, r = [1] * len(nums), 1, 1
        for i, j in zip(range(len(nums)), reversed(range(len(nums)))):
            res[i], l = res[i] * l, l * nums[i]
            res[j], r = res[j] * r, r * nums[j]
        return res
