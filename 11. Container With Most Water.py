# Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

 



# The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

# Example:

# Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49

        while l < r: res, l, r = (max(res,  height[l] * (r - l)), l + 1, r) if height[l] < height[r] else (max(res,  height[r] * (r - l)), l, r - 1)
        return res
